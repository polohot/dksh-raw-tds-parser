Presented as a white powder with a softening point between 90-110°C, L118 functions primarily as a crocodile pattern agent, improving the texture's height, three-dimensionality, and consistency. When dry blended at 0.2-0.4% into L107 formulations, it produces a moire appearance and significantly elevates the crocodile pattern effect, making it more pronounced and uniform. This product is ideal for applications requiring enhanced surface texture and visual appeal, particularly in coatings or finishes where a distinctive patterned effect is desired. Packaged in 25 kg kraft paper bags with polyethylene lining, L118 should be stored in cool, dry conditions away from heat and fire sources to maintain its quality and performance.",Dry blend 0.2-0.4% L118 when base powder coating has been finished.,(MANUAL_INPUT),['NA'],PIM000148513-TDS-L118.pdf,AAAA,[],(MANUAL_INPUT),(MANUAL_INPUT),[],(OPTIONAL)

The microcapsules release a gentle lemon fragrance naturally, which intensifies upon light friction as the capsules burst, providing a refreshing and revitalizing sensory experience. Aromaball P - Lemon is compatible with solvents containing higher carbon content and is recommended for use in applications requiring thermal resistance below 180°C for short durations to maintain fragrance integrity. Its versatility allows incorporation into textiles, coatings, plastic injection molding, paper products, stationery, and films, enhancing these materials with a long-lasting lemon scent. The product also offers benefits such as odor elimination, stress relief, and fragrance stability, making it ideal for specialty chemical industries aiming to improve product appeal through enhanced sensory attributes.",N/A,(MANUAL_INPUT),['TSCA'],PIM000149128-[GHS] Aromaball P Lemon.pdf,AAAA,[],(MANUAL_INPUT),(MANUAL_INPUT),[],(OPTIONAL)

These microcapsules typically have a mean particle size ranging from 1 to 5 micrometers and are formulated with a pH between 5.0 and 8.0, viscosity of 20 to 200 cps, and specific gravity of 0.9 to 1.2, ensuring compatibility with various substrates. The microcapsules do not contain harmful alcohols and are non-flammable, making them safe and versatile for industrial use. Their unique microencapsulation technology protects the active aromatic and functional ingredients from environmental degradation such as heat, light, and moisture, enabling controlled and sustained release of fragrances and functional agents. This product is widely applicable across multiple industries including textiles, paper, plastics, paints, and inks, where it can be easily integrated through standard processing methods like dipping, coating, or spraying. In textiles, the microcapsules can be applied with binders and cured at moderate temperatures to impart durable aroma and functional benefits such as antibacterial or anti-mosquito effects. The product spectrum includes a wide variety of scents such as Lavender, Vanilla, Mint, and functional variants like Vitamin E and Silver Master S-Series. Additionally, insilico's microcapsules offer cost-effective solutions to enhance product appeal and consumer experience by providing sustained fragrance release and added functionalities. Proper storage in cool, dark conditions and handling precautions ensure optimal performance. Overall, insilico's Aroma and Functional Microcapsule is a versatile, stable, and efficient solution for imparting long-lasting aroma and functional properties to diverse materials, supporting innovation in specialty chemicals and consumer products.","Microcapsule: 0.5 - 3% in textile application; Binder: 0.5 - 1.5%; Example recipe for 100 kg solution: 2% microcapsule (2 kg) with 2% binder (2 kg) and 96% other agents (96 kg).

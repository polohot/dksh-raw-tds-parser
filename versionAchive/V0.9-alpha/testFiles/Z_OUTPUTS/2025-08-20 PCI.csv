This white or almost white crystalline powder exhibits cytoprotective properties by preventing tissue damage and activating A2A receptors, which produce anti-inflammatory responses. Adenosine enhances tissue repair and reconstruction, reduces skin roughness and wrinkles, and supports skin night repair processes. It also promotes hair thickening comparable to minoxidil but with a faster prevention of hair loss and new hair appearance, leading to higher user satisfaction.

Pathogen-associated molecular pattern\n(PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) serves as a\nprimary plant defense response against microbial\npathogens, while plant Resistance (R) proteins can\nrecognize pathogen effectors to initiate a stronger\ndefense mechanism, termed effector-triggered\nimmunity (ETI). Part of the pathogen-associated\nmolecular pattern (PAMP) immune system of the\nplant is based in the production of an exudate,\nwhich acts as a chemical barrier, preventing attacks\nby pathogens and allowing for the recovery of the\nplant tissue.\nThis exsudate is mostly composed of\nheteropolysaccharides with a complex structure,\nwith different sugars such as arabinose, galactose,\nglucose, rhamnose, xylose and uronic acids that\nform a sophisticated polymeric structure with unique\nproperties.\nThe Acacia senegal is a species of leguminous\ngenus Acacia native to semi-desert regions of Sub-\nSaharan Africa.\nWhen subjected to attacks by microorganisms,\nenvironmental stress or suffer any physical damage,\nAcacia senegal exudes a gum that protects and\nhelps the plant in its regeneration.\nACTIMULSI GA 20 is a new ingredient,\nextracted from the exsudate of Acacia Senegal.\nACTIMULSI GA 20 is a branched\nheteropolysaccharide (acid arabinogalactan)\ncontaining approximately 70% of galactose\nand 12% of glucose, rhamnose, xylose and\nuronic acids. ACTIMULSI GA 20 also contains\nother defense-related molecules from the\nsecondary metabolism of the plant.\nDue to its structural characteristics,\nACTIMULSI GA 20 acts as a co-emulsifying\nnatural agent.\nEFFECT OF EMULSIFIERS ON THE SKIN\nEmulsifiers can damage the skin barrier by\nemulsifying the intercellular lipids and disrupting the\nlipid bilayer, increasing TEWL and impairing the\nprotective function of the skin.\nNormal struture\nemulsifier\nĮ\nLipid biryer\nDisrupted\nlipid biliyor\nWater los\nloss of protective function\nEVALUATION OF THE STABILITY OF\nEMULSIONS THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF\nMICELLES\nComputational analysis of the distribution of\nmicelles by size over time is a good method for\nevaluating the stability of an emulsion\n(See Figure 1).\nMicelles in less stable emulsions show a\ntendency to coalescence, but in stable\nemulsions they remain unchanged.\nCoalescence\n(grouping) of\nmicelles\nDifferent\ndiameters of\nmicelles\nFigure 1\n1\n\n## Page 2\n\nThe effect of ACTIMULSI GA20 on the stability of an\nemulsion was tested. A formula (Control Formula -\nCF) containing 2.75% Laureth-23 as a co-emulsifier\nwas compared with a test formula (Test Formula -\nTF) containing 1% of ACTIMULSI GA20, where the\nemulsifier concentration was reduced to 1%. The\nstability of both formulas was evaluated over 23 days\nusing computational analysis (a proprietary program\ndeveloped over a MATLAB™ platform).\nResults are seen below\nGraphs 1 and 2 below show the distribution of\nmicelles in the emulsions of control formula\n(CF) and test formula (TF1), after 2 and 23 days.\nCONTROL FORMULA\nHistograma - Diametric Diammedio\nHistograma - Diametr Diammedio\n2 days\n23 days\n% de micelas\n% de micelas\n20\n0405 0546 6607 07485 005-10 1013 1315 152/ 2830 3040 4958\nTamanho das micelar jens micras)\n90.03%\n9.97%\n85.00%\n15.00%\nAnalysis of the control formula with 2.75%\nLaureth-23 shows the increase of the number\nof large micelles, a clear indication that the\nmicelles in this formula are coalescing.\nTEST FORMULA\nHistograma - Diametr Diammede\nHistograma .

The use of ACTIMULSI GA\n20 into the test emulsion also allowed for the\nreduction of Laureth-23 by 63.6% without loss\nof stability.\nANALYSIS OF THE MORPHOLOGY OF\nMICELLES\nSimilarly to the analysis of the stability of\nemulsions, the computational analysis of the\nmorphology of the micelles is a good indicator of\nthe sensory attributes of an emulsion.\nEmulsions formed by spherical-shaped micelles\ngenerally have better sensory attributes when\ncompared to emulsions formed by odd-shaped\nmicelles.\nThus, the effect of ACTIMULSI GA20 on the shape\nof the micelles in an emulsion was tested. A formula\n(Control Formula - CF) containing 2.75% Laureth-23\nas a co-emulsifier was compared with a test formula\n(Test Formula- TF) containing 1% of ACTIMULSI GA\n20, where the emulsifier concentration was reduced to\n1%. The analysis of the shape of both formulas was\nevaluated using computational analysis (a proprietary\nprogram developed over a MATLAB™ platform).\nResults are seen below.\nGraphs 3 and 4 below show the distribution of\nmicelles accordingly to their shape (circularity\n/sphericity) in the control formula (CF) and test\nformula (TF2).\nCONTROL FORMULA\nHistograma - Circularidades\n80\n70\nCF\n60\n8\n% de micelas\n3\n30\n20\n10\n0\n09-10\n1.0-1.1\n1.1-12\n1.2.1.5\nCircularidade om micras)\nAnalysis of the control formula with 2.75%\nLaureth-23 shows a poor distribution of spherical\nmicelles in the emulsion.\nTEST FORMULA\nHistograma - Circularidades\n100\n90\nTF 2\n80\n20\n% de micelas\n60\n50\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0.9-10\n1.0\n11.12\n121.5\nCircuAvidade (em micras)\nTest formula with ACTIMULSI GA20 + 1%\nLaureth-23 shows a better sphericity, with 90% of\nthe micelles in the optimum range, while the control\nformula showed only 70% of the micelles in the\nideal range of circularity/shpericity.\nThe increase in the average sphericity of the\nmicelles in the test formula leads to a better skin\nfeel of the emulsion. Comparative tests performed\nwith both formulas showed a clear preference of\nthe panelists for the test formula (TF2), reaching\nhigh scores of \"smooth\" and \"silk touch\" and\n\"good preadability\" attributes.\n0405 0506 0647 07486 006-10 1013\nTamanho das\nklas\n1315 1599 9930 3640 7:49\n86.48%\n13.52%\n23 days\n0401 0500 0607 07001 08610 1013 1315 1620/2038 3848 4366\nTamanho das micell (om micron)\n2\n\n## Page 3\n\nANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY\nEvaluated by TNF-a release fom macrophage\nculture stimulated with LPS.

The molecule's larger size compared to glycolic acid results in slower skin penetration, making it well tolerated even by sensitive skin types. Mandelic acid has a pKa of approximately 3.41 and is soluble in water, with a melting range of 131–134°C. It is widely used in skincare for improving skin texture by reducing fine wrinkles and lines without causing erythema or irritation. Its lightening action effectively treats dermal and epidermal melasma and other hyperpigmentation issues, suitable for dark and sensitive skin due to its non-inflammatory nature. Additionally, mandelic acid exhibits antibacterial properties, making it ideal for acne treatment and managing occasional breakouts. It is also used in anti-aging products, photo-aged skin rejuvenation, and pre- and post-laser treatments to prevent bacterial infections. Recommended usage levels range up to 40% for resurfacing peels and around 10% for daily applications, with a buffered pH of 3 to 4. Overall, this mandelic acid product offers a versatile and gentle solution for exfoliation, skin renewal, acne management, and pigmentation correction, making it a valuable ingredient in personal care formulations.",Up to 40% for resurfacing peeling; approximately 10% for daily uses; buffer pH 3 to 4,(MANUAL_INPUT),['REACH'],PIM000009166-Mandelic acid _TDS_DKSH.pdf,AAAA,"['Anti-Aging', 'Anti-Bacterial', 'Anti-Dandruff', 'Anti-Itching', 'Anti-Microbial', 'Anti-Oxidant', 'Anti-Wrinkle', 'Brightening', 'Elasticity', 'Firming', 'Free Radical Scavenger', 'Moisturizing', 'Pore Refiner', 'Purifying', 'Scalp Protection', 'Skin Barrier Function', 'Skin Radiance', 'Skin Renewal', 'Smoothing', 'Soothing']",(MANUAL_INPUT),(MANUAL_INPUT),[],(OPTIONAL)

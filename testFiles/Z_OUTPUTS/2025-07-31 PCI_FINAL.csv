This product consists primarily of silica (89.7 - 94.7%), combined with functional additives such as triethoxycaprylylsilane, dimethicone, aluminum hydroxide, hydrogenated lecithin, and ceramide NP. The unique composition enhances the hydrophobicity and stability of the powder, allowing it to float on still water for over an hour, which indicates excellent water resistance. The inclusion of ceramide NP, a key skin lipid, suggests potential benefits in skin barrier support and moisturizing properties. The spherical porous structure of the silica provides a lightweight, soft texture that can improve the sensory feel and performance of cosmetic formulations. ADCL-SC-1 is manufactured under strict quality controls, ensuring low levels of heavy metals and microbial contamination, making it safe for use in personal care products.

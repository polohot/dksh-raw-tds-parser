Its larger molecular size compared to glycolic acid results in slower skin penetration, making it gentler and well tolerated even by sensitive skin types. Mandelic acid has a pKa of approximately 3.41 and is soluble in water, with a melting range of 131–134°C. It is widely used in personal care formulations for its multifaceted benefits including gentle exfoliation, improvement of skin texture by reducing fine wrinkles and lines, and lightening of hyperpigmentation such as melasma without causing inflammation or hyperpigmentation, making it suitable for dark and sensitive skin. Additionally, it exhibits antibacterial properties, making it ideal for acne treatment and prevention of occasional breakouts. Its applications extend to anti-aging products, rejuvenation of photo-aged skin, OTC treatments for pimples, rosacea, and hyperpigmented skin, as well as pre- and post-laser treatments to prevent bacterial infections. Recommended usage levels range up to 40% for resurfacing peels and around 10% for daily use, with a buffer pH between 3 and 4.

AQUPEC MG not only has the\nsignificant thickening capability of AQUPEC\nthickener family which allows getting highly\nviscous medium at low polymer concentration\nbut also, due to its unique structure, is able to\nprovide new fresher and lighter texture to a\nwide range of formulations.

Furthermore, AQUPEC MG can\nbe added in any preparation step, even at the end\nof formulation process, allowing modification and\ncorrection of formula viscosity.\n1\n\n## Page 2\n\nSUMITOMO SEIKA\nTECHNICAL DATA SHEET\nThickening mechanism\nAQUPEC MG high thickening capacity lies in\nthe polymeric\nstructure\nof\ncross-linked\npolyacrylate. When AQUPEC MG is dissolved in\nwater, due\nto the repulsion between\ncarboxylates, polymer chains expand generating\na three dimensional network, resulting in a\nhighly viscous gel (Figure 1). In contrast to other\ncarbomers, in the case of AQUPEC MG,\nneutralization step is not required, giving a pH\nclose to neutral without any further pH\nmodification.\nBasic polymer properties in water\n- Easy to disperse and handle\n- High thickening capability\n- Applicable for wide range of pH\n- Fresh and light texture\n- Less creasing\n-\nSprayable solution/emulsion\nEasy to disperse and handle\nOne of the most important issues formulators\nface in the use of commonly-used carbomers is\nthe management of addition method and\ndispersion time. Such carbomers are composed\nof irregularly shaped small particles of under\n10um, and the flowability of the polymers is\npoor. Thus, handling is not easy. On the other\nhand, the handleability has been significantly\nimproved in AQUPEC MG. Due to its 10-30um\nspherical and uniform shape, AQUPEC MG is easy\nto handle and has great flowability. Moreover,\nthe dissolution process has been notably\nimproved as well. In the case of commonly-used\ncarbomers, slow addition, special equipment, and\nhighly skilled operators are needed in order to\navoid lump formation, which leads to longer\ndispersion time. However, AQUPEC MG has great\ndispersibility in water, and rarely forms lumps. As\nfigure 2 shows, even the addition of AQUPEC MG\nwithout any stirring yields a fresh and free of\nlump gel.\nNa\nElectrostatic\nOOC\nrepulsion\nIn Water\nNa+\nCOO\"\nHOOC\nCOOH\nNa+\nCOO\nCOO\nNa+\nElectrostatic\nrepulsion\nExpanding molecular chains\nFigure 1: Mechanism of thickening of AQUPEC MG\nNINAW\nBefore Dissolution\nAfter Addition\n1 h Under Stirring\nGel (0.5 % in water)\nFigure 2: Dispersion process\n2\n\n## Page 3\n\nSUMITOMO SEIKA\nTECHNICAL DATA SHEET\n60000\n50000\nViscosity[mPa's]\n40000\n30000\n20000\n10000\n0\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nAQUPEC MG concentration[%]\nFigure3: AQUPEC MG concentration vs. viscosity\n30000\nAdd citric acid\nAdd sodium hydroxide\n25000\nViscosity [mPas]\n20000\n15000\n10000\n5000\n0\n-\n-\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\npH\nFigure4: Effect of pH in viscosity of 0.5% aqueous\nsolution of AQUPEC MG\nHigh thickening capability\nAQUPEC MG is an extremely efficient rheology\nmodifier with high thickening capability. The\naddition of small amount of AQUPEC MG into\nwater enhances texture properties, resulting in\na fresh and consistent gel. As figure 3 shows,\neven at low polymer concentration, medium\nviscosity is significantly high. The increase in\npolymer concentration leads to further increase\nin viscosity. Additionally, AQUPEC MG can be\nused in a large pH range (Figure 4) and the\nviscosity of AQUPEC MG gels is not significantly\naffected by temperature (Figure 5). Therefore, by\ntuning pH and polymer concentration, AQUPEC\nMG allows the preparation of a wide range of\nformulations by using it as single thickener.\nThe high shear thinning rheology profile of\nAQUPEC MG (Figure 6) is highly appreciated in\nformulations because it provides not only high\nviscosity and initial texture but also easy and\ncomfortable rub-in characteristics.\n30000\n25000\nViscosity[mPa . s]\n20000\n15000\n10000\n5000\n0\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nTemperature[C]\nFigure5: Effect of temperature in viscosity of 0.5%\naqueous solution of AQUPEC MG\n1,000,000\nzero shear viscosity\n100,000 €\n10,000\nViscosity [Pa's]\n1,000\nshear-thinning\n100\n10\n1\n0\n0.00001 0.0001 0.001 0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nShear rate[1/s]\nFigure6: Flow curve of 0.5% aqueous solution of\nAQUPEC MG\n3\n\n## Page 4\n\nSUMITOMO SEIKA\nTECHNICAL DATA SHEET\nTexture\nThe unique structure of AQUPEC MG allows\nthe preparation of formulations with new\ntextures, especially with fresher and lighter\nfeelings than those of normal carbomers.\nTextures are related to product rheology in\ngeneral, or more specifically, to rheology data in\nyield point. Strain and stress in the yield point\ncan be correlated, respectively, with the\nfreshness and lightness (Figure 7). Products\nwith lower yield strain and yield stress\nrespectively have fresher feeling and lighter\nfeeling. As shown in Figure 7, compared with\nCarbomer (AQUPEC HV-505E), AQUPEC MG\naqueous gel's yield strain and yield stress are\nlower, leading to fresher and lighter feeling.\nSimilar tendency is observed in the final\nproducts such as gel cream, cleansing gel and\nmoisture cream. Both yield strain and yield\nstress of products with AQUPEC MG are\nsignificantly lower than those of Carbomer,\nproving that new texture observed in AQUPEC\nMG aqueous gel can be easily transferred to the\nfinal products (Figure 8).\n100\nO : Gel cream\nCarbomer\nMoist\nFeeling\n: Creansing gel\nΔ: Moisture cream\n10\nYield strain[%]\n1\nAQUPEC MG\n0.1\nFresh\nFeeling\n1\n10\nYield stress [Pa]\n100\nLight\nFeeling\nHeavy\nFeeling\nFigure8: Yield stress vs. strain of formulations\n5.0\nMoist\n4.5\nFeeling\n4.0\n3.5\nYield strain[%]\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nYield stress[Pa]\nLight\nFeeling\nHeavy\nFeeling\nFigure 7: Yield stress vs. strain of aqueous gels\nCreasing effect\nCreasing effect, the polymer deposition when\nrubbed in, tends to occur in cosmetic products\n(especially in skin-care products) which contain\npolymers such as Carbomer. Creasing has a\nnegative effect in the customer perception as it\ncan be considered unpleasant, therefore,\ndecreasing the product acceptance. Several\nstudies have confirmed that, when compared\nwith cosmetic products containing Carbomer,\nthose containing AQUPEC MG produced hardly\nany creasing even at high concentration of\nAQUPEC MG (Figure 9 and Table 1).\n4\nAQUPEC MG\nFresh\nFeeling\nCarbomer\n\n## Page 5\n\nSUMITOMO SEIKA\nTECHNICAL DATA SHEET\nTable 1: Results of creasing evaluation\nPolymer\nPolymer\nconcentration (%)a)\nCreasingb)\n0.5 %\nNot observed\nAQUPEC MG\n1 %\nNot observed\n0.5 %\nObserved\nCarbomer\n1 %\nLarge amount\na\n30 % Propylene glycol\nb\nEvaluation method: Rub 0.5g of polymer gel in forearm\nduring 5 min.

With the use of traditional\nthickeners, a compromise between good\nstanding\nup/feeling\nproperties\nand\nsprayability should be made when spray is\nformulated. On the other hand, high viscosity\nof AQUPEC MG provides better stability,\ntexture and stronger hold and prevents\ndripping after spraying. Generally speaking,\nviscosity decreases product pumpability\nthrough nozzle and spray atomization area. As\nfigure 11 shows, when Carbomer is used, an\nincrease in viscosity significantly lowers spray\n100mm\nSpray area\nFigure 10: Measuring method of spray area\narea and therefore applicability.\nThe use of AQUPEC MG solves this issue,\nfacilitating the preparation of highly thick spray\nproducts, and opening\na\ndoor for\nimprovements in current formulation and the\npreparation of new ones which have been\ndifficult to achieve until now. As shown in\nfigure 11, comparing with the normal behavior\nexplained previously, highly viscous stiff gel\ncontaining AQUPEC MG is easy to spray, and\nhas similar spray area, while keeping all the\nexcellent properties AQUPEC MG gives to\nproducts such as high stability and fresh texture\nas well as non-drip property.\n200\n180\n160\nAQUPEC MG\n140\nTitu Jesse heads\n120\n100\nCarbomer\n30\n60\n40\n20\nD\n1DO\n1CHIDO\n15%Ethanol solution viscosity[ mPa-5]\nFigure11: viscosity vs. Spray area\n5\n\n## Page 6\n\nSUMITOMO SEIKA\nTECHNICAL DATA SHEET\nStorage & Handling\nAQUPEC MG is very hygroscopic and swells\nquickly in the presence of water.
